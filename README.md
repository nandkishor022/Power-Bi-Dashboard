# Power-Bi-Dashboard
1.	Data Collection: Ensure you have access to sales data for both LY and CY, segmented by state, district, product, customer, and category.
2.	Data Analysis: Use analytical tools like Excel, SQL, or a business intelligence tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) to create the comparisons.
3.	Visualization: Create visual representations like bar charts, line graphs, or tables to clearly show the LY vs CY comparison for each report.
4.	Reports Generation: Once data is analyzed, generate comprehensive reports that highlight key insights (growth, declines, top performers).
5.	Distribution: Ensure reports are accessible to stakeholders and decision-makers, either by email, through a shared portal, or via a business intelligence dashboard.[Dash Board.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18376376/Dash.Board.pdf)
